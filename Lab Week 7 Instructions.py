#Read in a file, split() it on space to get a list of words, then find every word
#that starts with a capital letter or has a digit
#See if you can read the words into a list using a list comprehension

#Start with an empty list and then use a for loop to add every integer between 1
#and 20 that is divisible by 3


#Use a list comprehension instead of a loop to add every integer between 1 and 20
#that is divisible by 3 to a list
